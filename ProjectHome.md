caravr is an AVR microcontroller based engine idle speed controller for Audi 200. To replace malfunctioning stock (analog) controller.

It should be usable on other engines with minor modifications, as long as they use a solenoid type fast idle valve (most European marques use this). Will not work on most American cars, with stepper type idle valves.


Inputs consist of engine coil (for speed monitoring), a line from the AC compressor (to increase idle speed when AC is on), and a line from a temperature sensor, for fast idle when the engine is cold.
